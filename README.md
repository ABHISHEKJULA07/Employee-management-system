## Key Features

* **Employee Database:** A centralized and organized database to store comprehensive employee records, including personal details, contact information, and job-related data.
* **Relational Design:** The system uses **relational tables with 1:N (one-to-many) relationships** to ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval. This structure prevents data redundancy and improves performance. 
* **User-Friendly Forms:** Interactive and intuitive forms are available for adding new employees, updating existing records, and viewing detailed employee profiles.
* **Custom Queries:** Built-in SQL queries provide powerful data retrieval capabilities, including:
    * **Leave Tracking:** Easily track and manage employee leave requests and approvals.
    * **Departmental Summaries:** Generate summaries of employee data based on departments for quick analysis.
* **Automated Reporting:** The application includes automated reports that can be generated on demand. These reports are designed to display monthly attendance and salary details, making it easier for HR to review and process information.
